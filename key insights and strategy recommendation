**Key Insights**
1️⃣ Sentiment Drives a Risk–Return Trade-off

The analysis shows that trader performance differs across sentiment regimes.
During Greed and Extreme Greed periods, average daily PnL is higher.
However, these periods also exhibit greater PnL volatility, indicating increased risk-taking behavior.
In contrast, Fear periods show relatively lower profitability but tighter performance distribution.
This suggests that optimistic sentiment encourages aggressive positioning, amplifying both gains and variability.

2️⃣ Trading Activity Increases During Greed

Trade frequency and average trade size increase during Greed regimes compared to Fear regimes.
Traders appear more active and confident when sentiment is positive.
Higher activity does not always proportionally improve win rate, indicating possible overtrading during strong bullish sentiment.
Fear regimes show more conservative behavior with reduced trading intensity.
This confirms that sentiment influences not only performance but also trading behavior.

3️⃣ Trader Segments React Differently to Sentiment

Segment analysis reveals heterogeneous behavior:
Frequent traders increase activity significantly during Greed periods, but their performance volatility also rises.
Large position traders benefit more during Greed regimes but experience sharper performance swings.
Consistent traders show relatively stable outcomes across sentiment regimes, suggesting disciplined risk management.
This indicates that sentiment sensitivity varies by trader profile.


**Strategy Recommendations**
Strategy 1 — Dynamic Risk Adjustment Based on Sentiment

During Greed regimes, traders—especially large position or frequent traders—should implement risk controls such as:
Reducing position size caps
Limiting maximum daily trades
Applying tighter stop-loss rules
During Fear regimes, disciplined traders may maintain moderate exposure while avoiding aggressive scaling.
This helps balance the risk–return trade-off observed across sentiment conditions.

Strategy 2 — Overtrading Control During Optimistic Markets

Since trade frequency increases significantly during Greed periods without proportional improvement in win rate, traders should implement:
A predefined maximum daily trade limit
Performance-based scaling rules
Activity thresholds triggered by volatility
This can prevent performance erosion caused by excessive sentiment-driven activity.
